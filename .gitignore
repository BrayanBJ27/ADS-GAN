# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipfile.lock can be added to .gitignore. Controversial,
#   as in #598:
Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for open source projects since this ensures any person who uses
#   the project will have the same dependencies as you do. For closed source projects, however,
#   it is generally better to not check in poetry.lock because by doing that, you are locking in
#   anyone who uses the project to have the same dependencies as you did when you created the
#   project. In this case, to get the latest set of dependencies, update the `pyproject.toml` file
#   to reflect the latest versions of the dependencies. Then, run `poetry update` to regenerate
#   the `poetry.lock` file.
